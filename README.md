A minimalist theme using TailwindCSS for Hugo based website to use as a starting point


Placeholder for now. Will keep an eye on [TailwindCSS v4.0](https://tailwindcss.com/blog/tailwindcss-v4-alpha) release and [Hugo's related TailwindCSS v4 (alpha) support](https://gohugo.io/functions/css/tailwindcss/)
